            <h2>Inputs to the SAF</h2>
            <p>
              The inputs to the Safety Assurance Framework (SAF) can be
              categorized into several key components: Operational Design Domain
              (ODD), system behavior, external requirements, and test
              objectives. These inputs include essential information such as the
              ODD description, system requirements, the system under test (SUT),
              variables to be measured during test execution, pass/fail criteria
              for successful testing, and monitoring requirements.
            </p>

            <h3>Operational Design Domain (ODD)</h3>
            <p>
              The ODD description outlines a range of relevant attributes, such
              as the maximum vehicle speed and permissible rainfall intensity.
              This description can take an inclusive approach (defining what is
              included in the ODD), an exclusive approach (defining what is
              excluded), or a combination of both.
            </p>
            <p>
              A standardized, machine-readable format, such as JSON, would
              greatly enhance the utility of ODD descriptions. For consistency,
              it is recommended to follow the guidelines outlined in ISO 34503
              (2023) when formatting the ODD. This description plays a critical
              role in scenario creation, enabling the generation of scenarios
              that align with the defined ODD. Additionally, it helps in
              formulating test cases and objectives, ensuring the safety of
              Automated Driving Systems (ADS) or Cooperative, Connected, and
              Automated Mobility (CCAM) systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ODD description is also vital for test evaluation, verifying
              whether the system operated safely within its ODD during a
              specific test. This evaluation is performed both during individual
              test cases and at the system level. Moreover, the in-service
              monitoring and reporting processes use the ODD description to
              verify that the system consistently operates within its defined
              domain throughout its lifecycle.
            </p>

            <h3>Requirements</h3>
            <p>
              Alongside the ODD description, the SAF considers system
              requirements for scenario creation, test objectives, system
              evaluation, and in-service monitoring. These requirements
              encompass a variety of elements, including behavioral
              competencies, external regulations, road safety rules, and best
              practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              The system’s requirements are crucial in generating scenarios and
              establishing test objectives. These objectives must ensure that
              the system meets all specified requirements. The process also
              defines how compliance with these requirements will be measured
              during testing. However, not all requirements can be directly
              validated through test cases. For instance, goals such as "achieve
              a 5-star Euro NCAP rating" or "maintain a failure rate below x%"
              apply more broadly to system-level evaluations rather than
              individual test cases.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, in-service monitoring relies on these requirements to
              assess whether system-level objectives are met throughout the
              system’s operational lifetime. Given the variability in
              requirements across different systems, formalizing these
              requirements remains a challenge, though a standardized format
              would be beneficial.
            </p>

            <h3>System under Test (SUT)</h3>
            <p>
              The System under Test (SUT) is central to the SAF, as it
              represents the subject being tested. Information about the SUT is
              provided to support scenario creation and the definition of test
              objectives. Scenarios may also be derived from knowledge of the
              SUT’s architecture and fault analysis techniques, such as
              Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA). The SUT can be
              represented as either a physical prototype or a mathematical model
              of the actual system.
            </p>

            <h3>Pass/Fail Criteria</h3>
            <p>
              Clear pass/fail criteria are essential for determining the success
              of test execution. These criteria are defined during the process
              of developing test scenarios and objectives, allowing for the
              assessment of whether test cases have been successfully executed.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, tolerances in vehicle speed or deviations in lateral
              path positioning should be specified. If a test case falls outside
              of the established criteria, the execution is considered
              unsuccessful. These criteria are applicable to both real-world and
              test-track environments, and similar standards can be applied in
              virtual environments, such as simulation outputs where errors may
              occur.
